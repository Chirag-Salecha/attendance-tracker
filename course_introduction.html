<h1>Course Project Introduction</h1>
<h3>Student Attendance Pattern Tracker</h3>

<div class="section">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The increasing emphasis on academic performance and student engagement highlights
the need for efficient monitoring and analysis of attendance data. Traditional
manual attendance tracking methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient
when dealing with large datasets.
</p>

<p>
Our project, <b>Student Attendance Pattern Tracker</b>, focuses on designing and
analyzing algorithms to efficiently process and analyze student attendance records.
By leveraging computational thinking and algorithm design techniques, the project
aims to identify attendance patterns such as consecutive absences and low attendance
trends.
</p>

<p>
The use of algorithmic principles ensures optimized data processing, minimal
computational overhead, and scalable solutions that support effective academic
monitoring and timely intervention.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <b>Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</b> course focuses on developing
efficient algorithms to solve computational problems. This project applies
algorithmic techniques such as iteration, divide and conquer, greedy strategies,
and pattern detection to a real-world academic problem.
</p>

<p>
The objective of this project is to implement algorithmic solutions for attendance
analysis, analyze their time and space complexities, and evaluate their performance
using realistic datasets.
